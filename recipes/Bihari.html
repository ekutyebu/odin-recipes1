    <p>These uniquely tender, aromatic, and smoky kababs remind me of my childhood in Pakistan. The smell that emanates from the grill has everyone drooling in anticipation every time I make these. Serve them with naan, sliced red onions, tamarind chutney, and green chutney. Try this unique and ancient recipe today. You won't regret it!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h5>Kababs</h5>
            <h5>Whole Spices</h5>
            <h5>Ground Spices</h5>
        </li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Pound tenderloin strips with a meat mallet until they are very thin; set aside.</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry onion in the hot oil until it is a deep brown, about 5 minutes. Strain browned onion into a small bowl using a slotted spoon, and set aside to use later.</p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Peel kiwi, cut into quarters, and set aside in a small bowl for later.</p>

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat, and toast gram flour until lightly browned and nutty, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Dry-roast poppy seeds in the same skillet until lightly brown and aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a small bowl; set aside</p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>In the same skillet, dry-roast nutmeg, mace, star anise, and Kashmiri chilies together until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the whole spices and chilies to a spice grinder, and grind them to a coarse powder.</p>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Add browned onions, kiwi, ginger paste, garlic paste, and serrano chile to the bowl of a food processor, and grind to a paste, about 30 seconds. Pour in mustard oil, white vinegar, and yogurt and pulse the food processor until everything is well blended, about 15 seconds.</p>

            <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>Last of all, add roasted poppy seeds, roasted gram flour, roasted ground whole spices, chili powder, cumin, garam masala, black pepper, and salt to the food processor; process marinade for 1 minute.</p>

            <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
            <p>For best results, mustard oil should be used, either by itself or mixed in a 1:1 ratio with another high smoke point oil like avocado, canola, or sunflower. I use a brand called Yandilla Mustard Seed Oil, available on Amazon.
                <p>The main thing in this recipe is the quality of the meat. The better the beef, the more tender your bihari kababs will be.</p>
                <p>Most of the spices listed can be found at your local grocery store or online through Amazon or specialty online spice stores like Burlap & Barrel, Spicewalla, and Diaspora.</p>
